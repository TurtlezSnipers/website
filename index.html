            Welcome! I am glad to find you on this website. My name is Diego, 
            and I am a server at Waffle House. However,
            you can also find me making YouTube videos <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/@sliteturtlez" target="_blank">
            here</a> on occasion. In 2027, I plan on returning to California
            and finishing my bachelor's in chemical engineering. For the time
            being, I will be learning web development.
